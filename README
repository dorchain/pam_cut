pam_cut
=======

Cuts off the last n (default: 44) characters of a password in the
pam stack.

Intended use is authentication with pam and yubikeys, where you
enter a static part and a OTP concatenated. The static part is
ignored by yubikey authenticator, but the static part
authenticator is confused by the OTP.

Sample useage (static part via ldap + yubikey OTP via radius)

auth required pam_radius_auth.so debug # OTP with radius
auth required pam_cut.so # to cut off the otp part
auth required pam_ldap.so try_first_pass # against AD
